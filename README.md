This is the user interface for the spinning disk remote laboratory developed at the University of Edinburgh. The full repo, containing hardware and software for the remote lab, can be found [here](https://github.com/practable/spinner-amax).

## Current state

This UI is in active development and used for research purposes. In particular it currently contains Learning Analytics tracking of user interactions with the UI, achievements and survey questions. A future update will release versions without these features.
